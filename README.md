<h1>James Bond Interactive Film Locations Map</h1>

<p>A customized interactive google map with locations of james Bond setting and filming locations. Could be easily adapted for other movies, series, or uses.</p>

<p>Clicks on the film links will display icons for the locations of the film. Each icon can open an infowindow which then can either make a
comparison between the filming and setting location, or open an information slider with more information.</p>

<p>The page makes use of the googlemaps API as well as substantial jquery, AJAX, PHP, mySQL, googlemaps infowindows script, and googlemaps marker script.</p>

<p>Current live version can be seen <a href="http://david-fisher.esy.es/jamesbond/bond_map.php">here</a></p>

<h2>Current updates needed</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Information for all of the films needs to be added. This includes the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of the filming and setting
  locations, and a brief description of the location</li>
  <li>Animated polyline function only works at 50%. Needs modification for speed and zoom levels, post animation click functions,
  and a solution to the problem of filming and setting being in the same location (From Russia with Love Istanbul for example)</li>
  <li>Information windows and communication with database works well with minor bugs needing to be corrected.</li>
  <li>A section 2,3,4 are intended to be added to the page but at the moment are disabled.</li>
</ul>
